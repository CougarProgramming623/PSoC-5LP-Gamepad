# PSoC-5LP-Gamepad

The main branch of this project contains the source used to build the CyController1.hex firmware for the Infineon (formerly Cypress) CY8CKIT-059 PSoC 5LP Prototyping Kit. This firmware allows the CY8CKIT-059 to be used as a USB gamepad as described in USB_HID_Example_Doc.pdf. This source was originally published by Cypress under the GPL v3. See https://web.archive.org/web/20201027115920/https://community.cypress.com/thread/30090.

Other branches of this project will contain 623's modifications of the original source (e.g., to add more buttons or change pin layout).
